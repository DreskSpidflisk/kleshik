Model description       : 
This is Chun-Li as she looks in Super Street Fighter2.  She wears her 7 colored 
chinese dress and she can perform her greatest special moves! Lightning Kick, 
Spinning Bird Kick, Rising Heaven Kick and Look-At-My-Butt Kikoken Fireball!
Never dreamed of getting hit by a knee-high leather boot?

Other info  :      	
Chun-li is the fifth model that I made.  Built from my humanoid base, I added a very flexible dress and two extra blue-foot for the Shadow-Moves effect.  The face texture isn't very detailled because I dont have access nor have the cash to buy a tablet, how pitful am I?? The model is a bit smaller that I expected.

More info is available on my Web page..
