Model Name              : Cammy (from Super Street Fighter 2/SSF2Turbo)
			  Version .90 ("beta")
installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/cammy

Model description       : From the classic Street Fighter fighting 
			  game series, Cammy is an unwitting double
			  agent under the control of M. Bison's 
			  ShadowLaw. And she's the cutest girl in 
			  any video game ever.

Other info              : This is a beta version of Cammy that I wanted
			  to put out right away, because I don't think
			  I'll have a lot of time to work on her for a 
			  little while. However, planned changes include 
			  some animation tweaking (especially with her 
			  legs in the crouch anims), VWEP for all weapons
			  in Q2 and Q2MP1/Q2MP2 and some more skins. 
			  Other suggestions/ideas for fixes are welcome 
			  and requested.

			  This is my second model (and not as much of
			  an improvement over my first as I would have 
			  hoped); comments are requested and most 
			  welcome, but try to go easy on unspecific 
			  criticism. "You suck," won't help me build 
			  better models.

			  Modeller, Npherno's Skin Tool, SkinView
Known Bugs              : I'm sure there are bounding box issues with
			  some of the animations... 
			  The crouch animations deform the legs a lot,
			  because of my inexperience with bones in 
			  Lightwave. Hopefully, this will be fixed 
			  eventually.
			  There's a skin mapping problem that I wasn't
			  able to figure out on the weapon.
			  The skin isn't as well optimized as I would
			  have liked. I may try re-skinning if I get 
			  around to it.
Build/Animation time    : 3 weeks, on and off.
