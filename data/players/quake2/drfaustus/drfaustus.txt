		residing in Los Angeles, CA.  He is one of the main combatants in Thrill Kill, a 
		Sony PlayStation 4 player fighting game to be released this October.
		
Installation:

	Unzip all the files into a subdirectory called "DrFaustus"
	in your players directory.  You can then select DrFaustus in
	the multiplayer setup menu in Quake 2.  That's all there is to
	it.

Skins:

	The skin used is the same as the skin used in the Sony PlayStation game.

Comments:

	If you have any comments, I would like to hear them.  Please
	send them to the email address mentioned above.

What I am currently working on:

	If there is a lot of interest, I may go ahead and do the "Belladonna" character 
	from Thrill Kill.  She is a hot, sexy, vengeful dominatrix with a cattle prod.  Ouch!

Special thanks to Kray-Zee for his help.

Have fun with the new model!
