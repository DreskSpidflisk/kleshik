Kleshik Modification v0.8.2
Supports Quake and the Two Mission Packs (hipnotic, rogue)
by Dresk (dresk@comcast.net)

1.0		OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------
	The Kleshik for Quake Modificaton is a modification for iD Software's Quake.  The primary goal of the Kleshik modification is to add various features supportive of the cooperative gametype, providing additional information and capabilities.  The secondary goal is to add feedback of any form to all gameplay elements, including but not limited to additional / different blood, more detailed gibbing physics, various weapon response elements and more.  The modification should also require little to no additional client data (outside of auto-downloading CSQC).
	
	This modification supports both Quake mission packs, Hipnotic and Rogue.  Their features are built into the Kleshik modification code and are enabled through CVars as detailed in the documentation.
	
1.1		REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------
	This modification primarily requires the Darkplaces Engine as many extensions are used, all of which Darkplaces supports.  Other engines may be capable of supporting the modification if they meet the extensions requirements outlined below.
	
	For compiling the modification, FTEQCC is required due to minimal usage of arrays and extensive usage of C-style function declarations.

1.3		QUICK HELP FOR EXPANSION PACKS AND ADDITIONAL MODS
--------------------------------------
	Kleshik supports the two Quake expansion packs, Hipnotic and Rogue.  Kleshik does NOT contain the data assets for these mods, however.  You must have both the "rogue" and "hipnotic" folder in your Quake path, with the appropriate data files.
	
	To tell Kleshik to load the data files for these mods, in the Darkplaces console, type in the following command when not playing any games : gamedir rogue hipnotic kleshik
	
	This will have Darkplaces load, in the order specified, the data files for the mods.  This results in the data for Rogue, Hipnotic and Kleshik to be loaded (along with id1, the base Quake game which is always loaded).
	
	You may add additional mods through this method as well.  For example, to use the Masque of Red Death mod, enter this command in the console : gamedir rogue hipnotic masque kleshik

3.0		QUAKE BUG / GAMEPLAY FIXES
--------------------------------------
	BUG			: Player Kill Messages Represent Current Weapon
				Damage Types are now implemented, allowing for dynamic resistances and other bells and whistles (see Explosions Always Gib).  This also allows for kill messages to be displayed properly, based on the weapon used for the kill, not the weapon currently being used by the killer.
				
	BUG			: hurt_triggers with negative damage (meant to heal) cause pain sounds and effects
				Map authors that used hurt_triggers to heal the player by using negative damage forced players to experience the effects of regular damage.  This has been modified to instead provide a heal sound and no damage effects.
				
	BUG			: Ammunition Pickups are item_weapon entities
				Although only a few ammunition pickps are affected (namely on DM5, DM6), some maps contain ammunition that is the item_weapon entity class.  This is a legacy class and should no longer be used.  The items are translated to the standard ammunition pickups.
				
	BUG			: Armortype Precision Loss in Spawn Parameters
				Quake normally unnecessarily stores a client's armortype in the spawn parameters as its value * 100.  This induces a loss of precision when the armortype is derived in the Decode procedure, as the armor is divide by 0.01 .  The armor is now stored as-is.
		
	BUG			: Player Immediately Attacking on Respawn (if attack used to respawn)
				Normally, when respawning with the attack button, a player would immediately fire their weapon.  This has been fixed using a "hack" to prevent an attack for 0.2 seconds after respawn.
				
	BUG			: Blood Spewing from Damageable Brushes
				Bullets and the axe were able to spew blood from damageable brushes, such as secret doors.  This has been fixed so that they spawn sparks instead.
				
	BUG			: Chthon (monster_boss) Stops Firing Missiles if all players are dead
				Chthon has flawed logic that seeks for a new target once his current one is dead.  If no new targets can be found immediately, Chthon goes into his idle stage wherein he will never choose a new target.  This idle stage is now appropriately flagged and will choose a new target as soon as possible.
				
	GAMEPLAY	: Player Suicide Utilizes Fake Death
				When a player enters kill in the console, Quake by default uses a pseudo-death system which simply respawns the player elsewhere and creates a corpse where they were.  This system did NOT invoke standard death routines.  This has been changed to simply cause T_Damage to the client, invoking standard death routines.
				
	GAMEPLAY	: Armor Reduced Drowning / Falling Damage
				All damagetypes in Quake were affected by the player's armor.  With Kleshik's implementation of damagetypes, drowning and falling damage now ignore armor.
		
	GAMEPLAY	: Monsters Telefrag other Monsters
				Given a monster teleports in at another monster's location, the monster is telefragged.  This is now suppressed unless the game is currently in an intermission, wherein it is still allowed.
		
	BUG			: Swimming Monster Total Count + 2
				Given a monster that swims (ie. only fish) the total monster counter was incremented by 2.  This has been modified to increment only by 1.
		
	BUG			: Player Pain Function Nightmare Issue
				The T_Damage function checked for the skill level, and if on 3 (Nightmare), the targets pain_finished time would increment by 5 seconds.  This was applied to players as well; the FL_MONSTER flag is now checked before applying the time.
		
	BUG			: Weapon Attack Finish Time Defers Non-Weapon Impulses
				Normally when a player attacks the attack finish time is assigned, and until that is reached no impulses are accepted, including non-weapon impulses.  Now impulses are allowed if they do not pertain to a weapon.
		
	BUG			: Axe / Mjolnir (Hipnotic) Wakes Up Monsters
				The W_Attack function normally induces a monster wake up based on any weapon.  This has been modified to exclude the axe, as it should not exactly be heard by monsters.
				
	BUG			: Hipnotic - Rubble Causes Damage when Still
				Normally the rubble debris in the Hipnotic mission pack will damage a player, even if the rubble is not moving.  This is retarded.  Rubble must now have some velocity if they are to cause damage.
				
	BUG			: Hipnotic - func_spawn Entities Spawn "Dummy" Monsters when using Random Spawn
				If a Hipnotic func_spawn entity is not given a spawnfunction and classname (ie. it should spawn a random monster), the entity would end up spawning five monsters and only utilizing one of them.  This was wasteful behavior, and has been modified to only spawn the entity needed.
